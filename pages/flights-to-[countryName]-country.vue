                        to a
                        few months in advance will give you much lower prices with fewer connections on cheapest flights to
                        <span class="font-semibold">{{ urlToString(countryName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + countryName.slice(1)) }}</span>. You may get a great deal on a one connection flight that's scheduled for a few weeks from
                        now.
                        But you will have to settle for a 3 connections flight if you wait to book the day before your
                        departure.

                        Save on Hotels for Lower Prices and Better Accommodations
                        Hotel prices vary wildly from one day to the next. If there is a big convention in town and all the
                        hotel's room will be filled at full price, you can expect to pay dramatically more.
                        <br />
                        During slower times when few rooms are filled, the same hotel's prices can drop sharply. If you want
                        to
                        save big on luxury accommodations, plan to travel during off peak times. You will also find airline
                        prices to those locations are far cheaper as well.

                        For most parts of the world, summer or the warm season is most popular and higher priced, while
                        winter
                        or the cooler season is far less expensive. Check the region you are traveling to for particular
                        details
                        on seasonal variations.
